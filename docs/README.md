**VaultDAO** is a Soroban-native treasury management dApp for high-value Stellar organizations. It brings the robust security of multi-signature wallets to the speed and efficiency of the Soroban smart contract platform.

Think of it as the **"Gnosis Safe of Stellar"** — built for DAOs, Enterprise Treasuries, and Investment Clubs.

## 🛡️ Features

| Feature                | Description                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Multi-Signature**    | **M-of-N** signing logic enforced on-chain. Requires cryptographic proof from multiple treasurers.           |
| **RBAC**               | Granular **Role-Based Access Control** (Admin, Treasurer, Member) defining exact permissions.                |
| **Timelocks**          | Large transfers (> threshold) are **locked for 24 hours** before execution, allowing emergency cancellation. |
| **Spending Limits**    | Enforced **Daily** and **Weekly** allowances to prevent budget overruns or drainage.                         |
| **Recurring Payments** | Automate payroll and subscriptions with rigorous interval checks.                                            |

## 🔒 Security Architecture

VaultDAO handles treasury funds, so security is paramount. The contract leverages **Rust** for memory safety and **Soroban's** simplified host environment to minimize attack vectors.

### Storage Strategy

To optimize for ledger rent and data capabilities, we use a hybrid storage model:

- **Instance Storage**: Used for `Config` (Global Settings) and `Roles`. This data is "hot" and always available to every contract invocation.
- **Persistent Storage**: Used for `Proposals` and `RecurringPayments`. These records must persist until explicitly removed or expired.
  - _TTL_: Automatically extended on access.
- **Temporary Storage**: Used for **Daily/Weekly Spending Limits**.
  - _Why?_ These records are ephemeral. Once the time period (day/week) passes, the data can be safely evicted by the network, saving rent costs.

### Testing

- **100% Logic Coverage**: The multi-signature voting engine, timelock delays, and limit trackers are fully covered by unit tests in `src/test.rs`.
- **RBAC Verification**: Every sensitive function invokes `require_auth()` and checks the caller's role against the stored registry.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Structure

VaultDAO is designed for scale and security.

- **Smart Contracts**: Built with Rust/Soroban using a hybrid storage model (Instance, Persistent, Temporary) to optimize for ledger rent.
- **Frontend**: A premium React dashboard integrated with the Freighter wallet.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for a deep dive into the system design and [STRUCTURE.md](docs/STRUCTURE.md) for folder organization.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust (1.70+)** & **WASM Target**: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- **Node.js (18+)**
- **Stellar CLI**: `cargo install --locked stellar-cli`
- **Freighter Wallet**: [Browser Extension](https://www.freighter.app/)

### 1. Smart Contract

Ensure you have Rust and the wasm32 target installed.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NovaGrids/VaultDAO.git
cd vaultdao

# Build the contract
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Run Tests
cargo test
```

### 2. Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory.

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` to view the dashboard.

For detailed setup and deployment instructions, see [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

### Run Tests

```bash
cd contracts/vault
cargo test
```

See [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) for more details.
